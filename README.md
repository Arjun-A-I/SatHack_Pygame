Have you ever seen a game for dumb people? 
Introducing SignLingo! An all in one app to learn and challenge ASL(American Sign Language)
Its an interactive game designed to help deaf individuals learn and master sign language. With its user-friendly interface and engaging gameplay, SignLing makes learning sign language both fun and educational.

The game is divided into different levels, each with its own set of sign language lessons. Users can progress through the levels at their own pace, learning and practicing their skills as they go.

Currently there are two levels, Level 1 and Level 2.

Level 1 involves learning phase where users can learn each hand sign (from A-Z) by imitating the hand sign image displayed nearby.
Camera live feed is taken and analysed to check if the user is doing the sign right.Together there is voice assistance to enhance the user experience.

Level 2 is about challenging your knowlwdge. Some objects will be shown and the user needs to spell it correctly through ASL. If its shown right another object will be displayed with growing difficulty.
